+Code the following app
+```
+A prediction market interface with a single question: "Will Bitcoin go up today?". The options should be: Moon (Up) and Doom (Down). Generate a vector style image for "Moon" (a green rocket) and "Doom" (a red bear) and use them as large voting buttons. The user can press a button to cast their vote, which triggers a progress bar animation that fills up to a random percentage over 2 seconds to simulate community sentiment. If the bar fills past 50% on their chosen side, display a "Winning Pick" message to the user, which they can share on their feed with their prediction. The user should be able to switch their vote only before the animation finishes. Place the prediction card on the home page.

+A virtual pet tracker featuring a "Base Blob". The blob states should be: Sleeping, Hungry, and Happy. Generate a vector style image with a white background for each state. The blob spawns in the "Sleeping" state. The user can press a "Wake Up" button to change it to "Hungry," and then a "Feed" button to trigger a bounce animation that plays for 1 second and changes the blob to "Happy". If the blob reaches the "Happy" state, display a "Streak Kept" message to the user, which they can share on their feed to show off their pet. Check the state directly using conditional rendering to swap the images. Place the pet interface on the home page.
