```
A prediction market interface with a single question: "Will Bitcoin go up today?". The options should be: Moon (Up) and Doom (Down). Generate a vector style image for "Moon" (a green rocket) and "Doom" (a red bear) and use them as large voting buttons. The user can press a button to cast their vote, which triggers a progress bar animation that fills up to a random percentage over 2 seconds to simulate community sentiment. If the bar fills past 50% on their chosen side, display a "Winning Pick" message to the user, which they can share on their feed with their prediction. The user should be able to switch their vote only before the animation finishes. Place the prediction card on the home page.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The following files are the ones that will most likely need to be edited or added to implement the requested prediction‑market interface, generate the required images, and update the app metadata:

1. `mini-app/app/page.tsx` – add the prediction card component to the home page.  
2. `mini-app/components/prediction-card.tsx` – new component that implements the voting UI, progress bar, and share logic.  
3. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` exported for the app.  
4. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create a todo file for the app logo.  
5. `mini-app/public/moon.png.todo` – create a todo file for the “Moon” (green rocket) image.  
6. `mini-app/public/doom.png.todo` – create a todo file for the “Doom” (red bear) image.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for each.

#### A virtual pet tracker featuring a "Base Blob". The blob states should be: Sleeping, Hungry, and Happy. Generate a vector style image with a white background for each state. The blob spawns in the "Sleeping" state. The user can press a "Wake Up" button to change it to "Hungry," and then a "Feed" button to trigger a bounce animation that plays for 1 second and changes the blob to "Happy". If the blob reaches the "Happy" state, display a "Streak Kept" message to the user, which they can share on their feed to show off their pet. Check the state directly using conditional rendering to swap the images. Place the pet interface on the home page.  

The following files in your repository are the ones that will most likely need to be edited or added to implement the virtual pet tracker you described:

1. `mini-app/app/page.tsx` – add the pet interface to the home page.  
2. `mini-app/components/pet-tracker.tsx` – new component that implements the blob states, buttons, animation, and share logic.  
3. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the app `title` and `description`.  
4. `mini-app/public/sleeping.png.todo` – create a todo file for the “Sleeping” blob image.  
5. `mini-app/public/hungry.png.todo` – create a todo file for the “Hungry” blob image.  
6. `mini-app/public/happy.png.todo` – create a todo file for the “Happy” blob image.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for each.

I need to add a new component and a few image‑todo files to implement the virtual pet tracker.  
Could you please add the following files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for them?

1. `mini-app/components/pet-tracker.tsx` – the component that implements the blob states, buttons, animation, and share logic.  
2. `mini-app/public/sleeping.png.todo` – todo file for the “Sleeping” blob image.  
3. `mini-app/public/hungry.png.todo` – todo file for the “Hungry” blob image.  
4. `mini-app/public/happy.png.todo` – todo file for the “Happy” blob image.  

Once those are added, I can give you the required changes.

I need to edit `mini-app/app/page.tsx` and `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to add the new component and update the title/description.  
Could you please add those two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for them?
